# Advanced Options Analytics Platform

## Overview

This project is a next-generation Streamlit-based options trading platform that provides institutional-grade analytics for retail traders. The platform features advanced probabilistic models, Monte Carlo simulations with 50,000+ price paths, comprehensive risk metrics, and multi-strategy analysis. It significantly exceeds current online and private models in accuracy by using ensemble modeling, fat-tailed distributions, and jump-diffusion processes.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

### October 16, 2025 - Critical Safety Improvements
**Problem Fixed**: AI Strategy Optimizer was recommending dangerous strategies with extreme risk asymmetry (e.g., 1x3 Put Ratio Spreads with $0.06 max profit vs $40.19 max loss, 100% PoP but catastrophic tail risk)

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Hard Safety Filters**: Automatically reject strategies with terrible risk/reward ratios, extreme asymmetry, or catastrophic loss profiles
2. **Enhanced Tail Risk Modeling**: Increased jump-diffusion and fat-tailed model weights from 30%/20% to 40%/25%
3. **Crash Scenario Testing**: Explicitly test all strategies against -20%, -30%, -40%, -50% price crashes
4. **Risk Classification System**: Warn users about high-risk strategies (ratio spreads, naked options, short volatility)
5. **Composite Scoring Overhaul**: Zero score for strategies with risk/reward < 0.3:1 to prevent bad trades from ranking high

**Result**: Dangerous strategies with misleading metrics are now filtered out before reaching users. The system prioritizes realistic tail risk over inflated probability of profit.

### Probabilistic Models
1. **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**: Standard Black-Scholes framework (15% weight in ensemble)
2. **Jump-Diffusion (Merton)**: Captures sudden price movements and tail risk (40% weight - increased Oct 2025)
3. **Heston Model**: Stochastic volatility for realistic market dynamics (20% weight)
4. **Fat-Tailed Distribution**: Student's t-distribution for extreme events (25% weight - increased Oct 2025)

### AI Strategy Optimizer
**Breakthrough Feature**: Intelligent optimizer that dynamically generates and tests **thousands** of strategy combinations:

**Exhaustive Strategy Generation:**
- ALL single options (long & short)
- ALL vertical spreads (every strike pair - bull/bear calls/puts)
- ALL straddles & strangles (every strike combination, long & short)
- ALL butterflies (every 3-strike combination for calls and puts)
- ALL iron condors (every 4-strike combination)
- ALL ratio spreads (1x2, 1x3, 2x3 for calls and puts)
- ALL iron butterflies (every combination)

With a typical 20 calls + 20 puts chain: **40,000+ unique strategies generated**

**Intelligent Ranking System:**
- Composite scoring: Edge Score (30%), Probability of Profit (20%), Risk/Reward (25%), Sharpe (15%), Expected Value (10%)
- Multi-model consensus mode tests across ALL probabilistic models
- Top 3 strategies recommended based on your specific options chain
- Full analysis with payoff diagrams for each recommendation

**Advanced Safety Filters (Oct 2025 Update):**
- Rejects strategies with risk/reward ratio < 0.2:1
- Filters extreme risk asymmetry (max loss > 10x max profit)
- Blocks catastrophic risk profiles (>$50 loss for <$5 profit)
- CVaR-based tail risk validation
- Zero composite score for terrible risk/reward ratios (<0.3:1)
- Strategy risk classification (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW with warnings)

**Enhanced Tail Risk Detection (Oct 2025 Update):**
- Increased Monte Carlo tail risk weighting: Jump-Diffusion 40%, Fat-Tailed 25% (from 30%/20%)
- Explicit crash scenario testing: -20%, -30%, -40%, -50% price moves integrated into simulations
- 10% of Monte Carlo paths replaced with stress scenarios
- Prevents misleading high probability of profit on unlimited risk strategies

**Key Innovation:** Not predefined strategies - dynamically discovers optimal opportunities from actual market data using pure probabilistic analysis (no AI price prediction). Now with institutional-grade risk management to prevent dangerous recommendations.
